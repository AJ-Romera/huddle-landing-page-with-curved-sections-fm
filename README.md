## Overview

### The challenge

This is a challenge from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-curved-sections-5ca5ecd01e82137ec91a50f2). (This is the web if you want to take the challenge or other frontend good challenges)

It consists on building out a huddle landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible, using any tool I like. It has to be responsive (at least mobile and desktop)
